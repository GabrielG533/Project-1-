# Project-1 Part 3 README- The Problem that I solved with the code below in this project is that when you clean the data you just get a bunch of organized values in a huge spreadsheet and visualizing that data is impossible. So by using a bar chart it become very easy to visualize the data. For example, in the cleaned data file when it came to gender we just saw the word man and woman being repeated down the cell multiple times repeadeatly. however, using the bar chart we are able to see how many people were men, how many people were women , and how many people were other. By graphing chart visualizing and understanding data becomes all the more easier.
